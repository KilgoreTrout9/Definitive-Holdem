# Definitive-Holdem
An all encompassing Texas Hold 'em simulator

This will be an interactive Texas Hold 'em simulator.  This will deal random hands to a specified
number of players from 2 to 10 per table.  Tournament mode will also be included and a certain number of entries will be spead through the room, all tables being dealt independently.

There will be 4 phases:
1.0 - MVP.  Dealing hands, all players play the same way.  Track results out to 1 million hands.
2.0 - implement different styles for different players
3.0 - set up a virtual tournament with as many as 1000 players
4.0 - would be to integrate ML

There will be a visual side written in react/hooks and a backend in Postgres.
